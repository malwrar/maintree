#![warn(missing_docs)]
//! A small helper that can
//! 1. Serialize the fields that differ between two structs of the same type
//! 2. Apply previously serialized field differences to other structs
//!
//! The SerdeDiff trait impl can serialize field paths recursively,
//! greatly reducing the amount of data that needs to be serialized
//! when only a small part of a struct has changed.

// NEXT STEPS:
// - Decouple from serde_json as much as possible. We might need to use a "stream" format with
//   well-defined data order to be able to use serde Deserializer trait. DONE
// - Make all fields work again. DONE
// - Make it work via proc macro. DONE
// - Blanket impl or impl-via-macro common std types (i.e f32, i32, String). DONE
// - Handle containers. DONE
// - Ignore type mismatches instead of propagating the error. IMPOSSIBLE??

// A problem occurs when encoding the command stream for bincode:
// We need to know the size of the list before we start serializing.
